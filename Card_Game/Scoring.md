## The Path to Scoring

We used score_data.py and score_decks.py to simulate Penney’s game and the Humble–Nishiyama game. While both games involve players selecting a sequence of three cards and scanning the deck to determine outcomes, the scripts differ significantly in how they define and count tricks.

In Penney’s game, the winner is the player whose chosen 3-card pattern appears more frequently in the deck. In Humble–Nishiyama, players collect cards each time their sequence appears, and the player with the most cards at the end wins. To evaluate strategy performance, our simulation tests all valid pairings of 3-card sequences, records win and draw counts under both scoring systems, and exports the results to a CSV file.

The score_data.py script enforces non-overlapping tricks. When a sequence match is found, the program skips ahead by three cards, preventing those cards from being reused in subsequent matches. For instance, given the deck [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] and Player 1’s sequence [0, 1, 0], only the match at positions 0–2 would count; the overlapping sequence at positions 2–4 would be ignored. This approach produces mutually exclusive trick counts, and in the card-counting variant, entire 3-card blocks are awarded to the matching player. The intent is to treat each 3-card window as a discrete unit to avoid “double-counting” of cards.

By contrast, score_decks.py allows overlapping matches. It scans the deck one card at a time, counting every occurrence of a sequence regardless if matches share cards. Using the same deck [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] and sequence [0, 1, 0], both positions 0–2 and 2–4 would be counted, giving Player 1 two tricks. In the Humble–Nishiyama variant implemented here, cards are dynamically allocated to a “pot” as matches occur, rather than being awarded in fixed 3-card chunks. This results in continuous scoring that does not accurately reflect playing the game in real life. 

To compare the two approaches, we ran identical decks through both scripts and analyzed the resulting trick counts and card totals. While the results were reproducable for both variants of the Humble-Nishiyama games, the results did not match for winning by tricks; the overlapping method in score_decks.py tends to inflate counts by reusing shared cards across multiple tricks. While both methods reflect different intuitions about gameplay, the logic in score_data.py more accurately captures the intended mechanics of Penney’s and Humble–Nishiyama: once a sequence is matched, its cards are consumed and cannot contribute to another trick.
