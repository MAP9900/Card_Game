## Purpose

## Quick Start Guide:

The Card Game Project is managed using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/). To check if UV is installed run uv in terminal. If successfully installed, the uv help and command menu will appear. Otherwise, follow the install guidelines on [UV's website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/).
<br>
With UV properly installed, download this repository and once navigated to the directory, run uv sync to install Card_Game dependencies. 
<br>
To run Card Game: uv run main.py
<br>
Running the program will score any un-scored decks and then start the user interface where the user may choose to add new decks to the running total. The user may also give a specific seed for the new decks or skip, defaulting to a random seed.
